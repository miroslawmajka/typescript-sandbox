# TypeScript Sandbox

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/miroslawmajka/typescript-sandbox/_apis/build/status/miroslawmajka.typescript-sandbox?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/miroslawmajka/typescript-sandbox/_build/latest?definitionId=5&branchName=master)

Just playing about with TypeScript and see where I end up.

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Run the entry point with `npm start`.

You can debug in VS Code using defined **Launch Program** configuration.

The `tsconfig.json` "rootDir" property must be set to `src` for the debugger breakpoints to work!

Type `npm run build` and `npm run dist` to run the distributable package as it is meant to be run in production.
