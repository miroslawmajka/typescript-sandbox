# TypeScript Sandbox

Just plyaing about with TypeScript and see where I end up.

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Run the entry point with `npm start`.

You can debug in VS Code using defined **Launch Program** configuration.

The `tsconfig.json` "rootDir" property must be set to `src` for the debugger breakpoints to work!
